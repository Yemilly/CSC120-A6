- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    * my initial impression of inherintance was that it was pretty helpful when creating the other classes, having the building parent class. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    * I had a lot of trouble trying to figure out the hashtable, and I kept having trouble trying to figure out my bug for the cafe values not being used. it was definitely tricky but playing around with my code and with the examples from class really helped figure out my next steps overall.
